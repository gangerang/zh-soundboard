# ZH Soundboard

## What is this?
This is a soundboard for my favorite game, Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour, which was released way back in 2003. In 2025, all the source code for the game was publically released by EA.

I created this for my friends so we can play those iconic unit lines at each other.

## About

A web-based soundboard for Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour units. You can search and filter units by name, faction, and unit type, and then play voice lines by clicking on action buttons. The project uses two JSON files:

- voices.json - Contains voice configurations for each unit (actions, sound files, volume, etc.). Based on the original voice.ini file.
- units.json - Contains unit classification data (Unit Name, Unit Code, Faction, and Unit Type). Manually created.

The interface displays unit icons, voice action buttons, and toggleable filters (including faction icons and unit type buttons) with color schemes aligned to each faction.
Features

- Voice Playback: Click action buttons to play a random sound from the available voice files.
- Unit Filtering: Search units by name, faction, and unit type.
- Factions & Icons: Units are classified into USA, GLA, and China, with color-coded action buttons and filter icons.
